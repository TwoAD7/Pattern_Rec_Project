### Approach to problem 
The over all goal of this is to be able to classfiy images based on the following features:
- Color
- Brightness 
- Size 
- Shape
---

__The approach entails__
* Extracting images from [Viz-wiz](https://vizwiz.org/tasks-and-datasets/vqa/) 
  * Extraction of images will be chosen to best represent each feature 
* Pixel data extraction 
  * This will be done with OpenCV or the Python Image Library (PIL)
  * This will be done in pre-processing the images
